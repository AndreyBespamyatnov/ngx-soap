# ngx-soap

Simple SOAP client for Angular 5 based on amazing [node-soap](https://github.com/vpulim/node-soap) library which apparently should only work in a node ambient and not in browsers.

Project recreated with Angualr 6 CLI.

To test: 
- git clone -b angular6-cli-ilb https://github.com/lula/ngx-soap.git
- cd ngx-soap && npm install
- ng build ngx-soap
- ng serve
