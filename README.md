# ngx-soap

Simple SOAP client for Angular 6 based on amazing [node-soap](https://github.com/vpulim/node-soap) library which apparently should only work in a node ambient and not in browsers.

Project has been recreated from scratch with Angualr 6 CLI.

To test:

1. `git clone -b angular6-cli-ilb https://github.com/lula/ngx-soap.git`
2. `cd ngx-soap && npm install`
3. `ng build ngx-soap`
4. `ng serve`

See example app under `src/app`
